\# 🐍 Python Portfolio
A curated collection of Python projects exploring agentic AI, automation, data workflows, and hands‑on engineering.

This portfolio highlights work across:
- Agentic AI systems (AutoGen, RAG, multi‑agent workflows)
- Interactive applications (Streamlit, tool‑augmented agents)
- Data engineering and analysis
- Automation and scripting

Each project is self‑contained, documented, and runnable.
